# Title of Paper: 
A Decision Theoretic Approach for Evaluating Bayesian Response-Adaptive Randomization and Frequentist Group Sequential Clinical Trial Designs with Binary Outcomes

# Purpose of the R Scripts:
These programs faciliate implementing the simulation study performed in the above manuscript that compares various classical frequentist group sequential designs with several Bayesian response-adaptive randomization (RAR) group sequential designs.  

# Brief Description of the R Scripts:

# 1. RAR_findnmax_functions.R
These functions may be used to determine the maximum sample size and posterior probability stopping boundaries (either Pocock or OBF-like) required to achieve 90% power and a 0.05 type I error rate in a Bayesian RAR group sequential design. These designs are implemented using a logistic regression probability model with weakly informative t-distribution priors for beta0 and beta1, and the mass-weighted urn design is used for randomization. Users may implement these designs using 1 of the following 4 adaptive modifications to the randomization probability: "RAR Restrict", "RAR Tune", "RAR Neyman", and "RAR Optimal", all of which are described in detail in the above manuscript. The inputs, outputs, and purposes of each function in this file are described in detail in the R script and an example is provided. 

# 2. RAR_Potential_Outcomes_Functions:
These functions may be used to execute a Bayesian RAR group sequential clinical trial using the potential outcomes framework proposed in the above manuscript. The posterior probability stopping boundaries found using the RAR_findnmax_functions.R script are applied to the trial to allow for early stopping. A trial is stopped early if the posterior probability that the treatment is better than the control exceeds a stopping boundary. The following metrics are computed: trial sample size, number of participants assigned to the treatment arm, number of participants assigned to the control arm, number of responders in the treatment arm, number of responders in the control arm, total number non-responders in the actual trial, total number of non-responders in the potential study sample, a binary indicator for whether the trial was stopped early for efficacy, and a binary indicator for whether the trial was stopped early for harm. The inputs, outputs, and purposes of each function in this file are described in detail in the R script and an example is provided. 

# 3. Freq_Potential_Outcomes_Functions:
These functions may be used to execute a classical frequentist group sequential clinical trial using the potential outcomes framework proposed in the above manuscript. Users should use the "gsDesign" package to find the maximum sample size and stopping boundaries that achieve 90% power and a 0.05 type I error rate for the desired design. Users may use 1 of the following 3 two-sample binomial proportion tests: Fisher's exact test, the chi-square test, or an unconditional exact test. A trial is stopped early if the two-sided p-value from the chosen two-sample binomial proportion test is smaller than the two-sided p-value corresponding to the z-score stopping boundary at a given interim analysis. The following metrics are computed: trial sample size, number of participants assigned to the treatment arm, number of participants assigned to the control arm, number of responders in the treatment arm, number of responders in the control arm, total number non-responders in the actual trial, total number of non-responders in the potential study sample, a binary indicator for whether the trial was stopped early for efficacy, and a binary indicator for whether the trial was stopped early for harm. The inputs, outputs, and purposes of each function in this file are described in detail in the R script and an example is provided.
